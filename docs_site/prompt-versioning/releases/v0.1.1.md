# Promptic v0.1.1

## Highlights

- **Hierarchical Variable Insertion** – `render_node_network()` now applies substitutions on a per-node basis using sanitized hierarchical paths, so simple, node, and path scopes all work when rendering complex trees.
- **Network Reuse Safety** – Rendering with variables no longer mutates the original `NodeNetwork`; the SDK creates a deep copy before applying substitutions so multiple renders can share the same loaded network.
- **Test Coverage** – Added `tests/integration/test_variable_insertion.py` to exercise every scoping mode plus repeated renders, alongside the existing unit tests for `VariableSubstitutor`.
- **Documentation Updates** – Expanded `docs_site/variables/insertion-guide.md` with details on path sanitization rules and clarified that scoped substitutions now work for deeply nested hierarchies.

## Upgrade Notes

- Path-scoped variable keys now use sanitized directory segments (`group-one/details.md` ➜ `root.group_one.details`). Update any existing scripts to match the sanitized names if you previously relied on unsanitized segments.
- Because substitution happens before rendering, file-first mode continues to substitute only the root node while full mode handles every inlined child.
