# Context Blueprint Authoring (Phase 1 Stub)

This document will eventually describe how to author hierarchical context blueprints
with prompts, instruction trees, data slots, and memory slots. During Phase 1 we only
set up the documentation structure so engineers can add end-to-end walkthroughs once
the builder/previewer services exist.

## Planned Sections

- Blueprint schema overview referencing `ContextBlueprint`, `BlueprintStep`, and slot entities.
- Python SDK workflow for creating new blueprints and previewing them.
- Troubleshooting checklist for validation errors (missing assets, cyclic references, etc.).
