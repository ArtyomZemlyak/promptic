# Execution Recipes (Phase 1 Stub)

Pipeline execution, hierarchical instruction traversal, and logging recipes will live here.
For now we capture the outline so the team has a dedicated location for examples once the
`PipelineExecutor` ships.

## Planned Sections

- Sample five-step pipeline with nested instructions.
- Loop/branch execution strategies and logging expectations.
- Integrating execution outputs with downstream agent orchestrators.
