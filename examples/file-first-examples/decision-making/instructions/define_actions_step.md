## Action Definition

Each action should be:
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Actionable**: Can be executed directly
- **Measurable**: Success can be verified
- **Realistic**: Achievable with available resources
- **Time-bound**: Has clear deadline

## Action Breakdown

- Start with high-level phases
- Break phases into major activities
- Decompose activities into tasks
- Define task details and requirements
- Ensure logical sequencing

## Action Documentation

For each action:
- Clear description
- Expected outcome
- Resource requirements
- Dependencies
- Timeline
- Success criteria

## Action Sequencing

- Identify prerequisite actions
- Determine parallel opportunities
- Establish critical path
- Plan for contingencies
- Optimize for efficiency

## Action Validation

- Verify actions are necessary
- Check they're sufficient
- Ensure they're achievable
- Confirm proper sequencing
- Validate resource allocation
