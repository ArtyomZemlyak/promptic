# Assess Risks and Consequences

Evaluate potential negative outcomes and their likelihood.

## Risk Categories

1. **Strategic risks**: Impact on long-term goals
2. **Operational risks**: Impact on day-to-day operations
3. **Financial risks**: Impact on budget and resources
4. **Reputational risks**: Impact on image and relationships
5. **Compliance risks**: Impact on regulatory requirements

## Risk Assessment

For each risk:
- **Description**: What could go wrong?
- **Likelihood**: How probable is it?
- **Impact**: How severe would it be?
- **Detectability**: How easily can it be detected?
- **Mitigation**: How can it be prevented or managed?

## Risk Matrix

Plot risks on likelihood vs impact matrix:
- **High likelihood, high impact**: Critical risks
- **High likelihood, low impact**: Manage closely
- **Low likelihood, high impact**: Monitor and prepare
- **Low likelihood, low impact**: Accept or monitor
