# Define Problem and Objectives

Clearly articulate the problem to be solved and desired outcomes.

## Problem Definition

1. **State the problem**: What needs to be decided?
2. **Identify root cause**: Why is this decision needed?
3. **Define scope**: What is included and excluded?
4. **Clarify constraints**: What limitations exist?
5. **Set objectives**: What outcomes are desired?

## Problem Statement Quality

A good problem statement:
- Is specific and clear
- Focuses on the core issue
- Is measurable or verifiable
- Avoids assumptions
- Separates symptoms from causes

## Objectives Definition

Define clear objectives that are:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined
- **Measurable**: Can be quantified
- **Achievable**: Realistic given constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with broader goals
- **Time-bound**: Have clear timelines

## Problem Validation

- Confirm problem is real and significant
- Verify it's the right problem to solve
- Check alignment with stakeholders
- Ensure scope is appropriate
- Validate objectives are achievable
