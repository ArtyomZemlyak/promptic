# Set Timeline and Milestones

Establish realistic timeline with clear milestones.

## Timeline Development

1. **Estimate durations**: How long will each action take?
2. **Identify dependencies**: What must happen first?
3. **Sequence activities**: What order makes sense?
4. **Set milestones**: What are key checkpoints?
5. **Build in buffer**: Account for uncertainty

## Timeline Elements

- Start and end dates
- Major phases and milestones
- Key dependencies
- Critical path activities
- Buffer time for risks

## Milestone Definition

Milestones should be:
- **Significant**: Mark important progress
- **Measurable**: Clear completion criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic given constraints
- **Relevant**: Meaningful to stakeholders
- **Time-bound**: Have specific dates

## Timeline Optimization

- Identify critical path
- Look for parallel opportunities
- Optimize resource allocation
- Balance speed and quality
- Plan for contingencies

## Timeline Documentation

- Detailed schedule with dates
- Milestone definitions
- Dependency mapping
- Resource allocation timeline
- Risk buffer allocation
