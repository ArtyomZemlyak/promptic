# Refine and Consolidate Options

Develop and polish options into well-defined alternatives.

## Refinement Process

1. **Review options**: Assess all generated alternatives
2. **Eliminate duplicates**: Remove redundant options
3. **Combine similar**: Merge related ideas
4. **Develop details**: Expand on promising options
5. **Validate feasibility**: Ensure options are viable

## Option Development

For each refined option:
- Clear, descriptive name
- Detailed description
- Key characteristics and features
- Resource requirements
- Implementation approach
- Expected outcomes

## Consolidation Criteria

- Options should be distinct
- Each should address the problem
- All should be reasonably feasible
- Range should include varied approaches
- Number should be manageable (3-7 typically)

## Option Validation

- Verify each option is complete
- Check alignment with objectives
- Assess initial feasibility
- Ensure distinctiveness
- Confirm worthiness for evaluation

## Documentation

- Document refined options clearly
- Include rationale for inclusions/exclusions
- Note any assumptions
- Record stakeholder input
- Prepare for systematic evaluation
