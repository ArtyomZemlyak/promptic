# Compute Descriptive Statistics

Calculate comprehensive statistical summaries for all variables.

## Statistical Measures

### Central Tendency
- Mean (average)
- Median (middle value)
- Mode (most frequent)

### Dispersion
- Standard deviation
- Variance
- Range (min, max)
- Interquartile range (IQR)

### Distribution Shape
- Skewness (symmetry)
- Kurtosis (tail heaviness)

## Per-Variable Statistics

Compute for each numeric variable:
- Count of non-null values
- All central tendency measures
- All dispersion measures
- Distribution shape metrics

## Categorical Variables

For categorical variables:
- Frequency counts
- Percentage distributions
- Mode and frequency of mode
