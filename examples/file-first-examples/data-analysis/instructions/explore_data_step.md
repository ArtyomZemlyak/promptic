Conduct comprehensive exploration to understand data characteristics.

## Exploration Goals

1. Understand data distribution
2. Identify patterns and relationships
3. Detect anomalies and outliers
4. Form hypotheses for further analysis

## Exploration Techniques

- Summary statistics (mean, median, std dev)
- Distribution visualizations (histograms, box plots)
- Correlation matrices
- Frequency tables for categorical data
- Time series plots for temporal data

## Key Questions

- What are the central tendencies?
- How is data distributed?
- Are there unusual patterns?
- What relationships exist between variables?
- Are there temporal trends?
