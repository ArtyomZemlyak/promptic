# Review Business Logic

Evaluate the correctness and clarity of the implemented logic.

## Logic Review Steps

1. **Trace execution flow**: Follow the code path for typical cases
2. **Check edge cases**: Verify handling of boundary conditions
3. **Validate assumptions**: Ensure preconditions and postconditions are met
4. **Review algorithms**: Confirm chosen approach is appropriate

## Common Issues

- Off-by-one errors
- Missing null/None checks
- Incorrect loop conditions
- Race conditions in concurrent code
- Memory leaks or resource cleanup

## Questions to Ask

- Is the logic correct for all input scenarios?
- Are error cases handled properly?
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Could this logic be simplified?
