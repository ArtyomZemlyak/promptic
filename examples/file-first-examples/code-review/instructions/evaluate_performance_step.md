# Evaluate Performance Impact

Assess how changes affect system performance and resource usage.

## Performance Metrics

1. **Time complexity**: Analyze algorithm efficiency
2. **Space complexity**: Check memory usage patterns
3. **I/O operations**: Review database queries and file operations
4. **Network calls**: Evaluate API request patterns

## Red Flags

- N+1 query problems
- Unbounded loops or iterations
- Large data structures in memory
- Synchronous blocking operations
- Missing caching opportunities

## Recommendations

- Suggest optimizations for identified bottlenecks
- Recommend profiling for performance-critical paths
- Propose caching strategies where appropriate
- Advise on async/parallel processing when beneficial
