# Analyze Code Changes

Review the diff to understand what has changed and why.

## Process

1. **Read the PR description**: Understand the intent and context
2. **Examine the diff**: Look at all changed files systematically
3. **Identify patterns**: Note recurring issues or improvements
4. **Check alignment**: Ensure changes match the stated purpose

## Key Questions

- Does the code solve the stated problem?
- Are there unintended side effects?
- Is the implementation the simplest solution?
- Could this be done more efficiently?
