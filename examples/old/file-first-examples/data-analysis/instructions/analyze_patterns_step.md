# Pattern Analysis

Identify meaningful patterns and relationships in the data.

## Pattern Types

1. **Correlations**: Linear and non-linear relationships
2. **Trends**: Temporal or sequential patterns
3. **Clusters**: Groups of similar observations
4. **Anomalies**: Unusual patterns or events
5. **Cycles**: Recurring patterns over time

## Analysis Approach

- Start with simple patterns (correlations)
- Progress to complex patterns (interactions)
- Validate patterns statistically
- Consider domain context
- Document all findings

## Pattern Validation

- Statistical significance testing
- Cross-validation with subsets
- Domain expert review
- Comparison with external data
- Sensitivity analysis
