# Create Actionable Recommendations

Transform insights into specific, implementable recommendations.

## Recommendation Structure

Each recommendation should include:

1. **Action**: Specific step to take
2. **Rationale**: Why this action is recommended
3. **Expected outcome**: What should happen
4. **Implementation steps**: How to execute
5. **Success metrics**: How to measure success

## Recommendation Types

- **Immediate actions**: Quick wins with high impact
- **Strategic initiatives**: Longer-term improvements
- **Risk mitigations**: Address identified risks
- **Optimization opportunities**: Improve efficiency
- **Research needs**: Areas requiring further analysis

## Prioritization

Rank recommendations by:
- Impact (high, medium, low)
- Effort (easy, moderate, difficult)
- Urgency (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- Dependencies (prerequisites)

## Best Practices

- Be specific and actionable
- Include implementation guidance
- Set realistic expectations
- Define success criteria
- Consider resource requirements
