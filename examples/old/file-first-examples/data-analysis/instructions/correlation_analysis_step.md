# Correlation Analysis

Examine relationships between variables to identify dependencies.

## Correlation Methods

1. **Pearson correlation**: Linear relationships (numeric variables)
2. **Spearman correlation**: Monotonic relationships (rank-based)
3. **Kendall's tau**: Ordinal relationships
4. **Cramér's V**: Categorical relationships

## Analysis Process

1. Compute correlation matrix for all pairs
2. Identify strong correlations (>0.7 or <-0.7)
3. Check for multicollinearity issues
4. Visualize with heatmap
5. Interpret in domain context

## Important Considerations

- Correlation ≠ causation
- Check for non-linear relationships
- Consider confounding variables
- Validate with domain knowledge
- Document all significant findings

## Red Flags

- Perfect correlation (may indicate duplicates)
- Unexpected strong correlations
- Missing relationships where expected
- Multicollinearity in modeling context
