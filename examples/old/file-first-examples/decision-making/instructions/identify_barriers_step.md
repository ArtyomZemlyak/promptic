# Identify Barriers and Risks

Identify obstacles that could prevent successful implementation.

## Barrier Types

1. **Technical barriers**: Technology or capability limitations
2. **Resource barriers**: Lack of people, money, or materials
3. **Organizational barriers**: Structure, culture, or process issues
4. **External barriers**: Market, regulatory, or environmental factors
5. **Timeline barriers**: Time constraints or dependencies

## Barrier Identification

- Analyze each feasibility dimension
- Review historical similar decisions
- Consult experts and stakeholders
- Consider worst-case scenarios
- Examine dependencies and assumptions

## Barrier Assessment

For each barrier:
- **Description**: What is the barrier?
- **Severity**: How significant is it?
- **Likelihood**: How probable is it?
- **Impact**: What would happen if it occurs?
- **Mitigation**: How can it be addressed?

## Barrier Documentation

- List all identified barriers
- Categorize by type
- Assess severity and likelihood
- Note potential impacts
- Document mitigation options

## Barrier Analysis

- Prioritize barriers by impact
- Identify critical barriers
- Assess overall barrier level
- Determine if barriers are surmountable
- Plan mitigation strategies
