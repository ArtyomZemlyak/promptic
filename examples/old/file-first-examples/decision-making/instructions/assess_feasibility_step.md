# Assess Feasibility

Determine whether each option can realistically be implemented.

## Feasibility Dimensions

1. **Technical**: Can it be done technically?
2. **Financial**: Can we afford it?
3. **Resource**: Do we have necessary resources?
4. **Timeline**: Can it be done in time?
5. **Organizational**: Can we execute it?

## Feasibility Assessment

For each dimension:
- Identify requirements
- Assess current capabilities
- Identify gaps
- Evaluate gap-closing options
- Determine overall feasibility

## Feasibility Scoring

Rate each dimension (0-1 scale):
- **0.8-1.0**: Highly feasible
- **0.6-0.8**: Moderately feasible
- **0.4-0.6**: Challenging but possible
- **0.2-0.4**: Difficult, significant barriers
- **0.0-0.2**: Not feasible

## Feasibility Factors

- Technical complexity
- Resource availability
- Budget constraints
- Time requirements
- Organizational capacity
- Regulatory considerations
- Market conditions
