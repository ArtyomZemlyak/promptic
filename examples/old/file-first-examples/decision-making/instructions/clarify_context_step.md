# Clarify Context and Scope

Understand the full context surrounding the decision.

## Context Elements

1. **Background**: What led to this decision?
2. **Current state**: What is the situation now?
3. **Drivers**: What factors are driving the need?
4. **Environment**: What external factors matter?
5. **History**: What previous decisions relate?

## Scope Definition

Clearly define:
- **In scope**: What is included in this decision
- **Out of scope**: What is explicitly excluded
- **Boundaries**: Where this decision's impact ends
- **Dependencies**: What other decisions or factors affect this
- **Assumptions**: What we're assuming to be true

## Scope Validation
