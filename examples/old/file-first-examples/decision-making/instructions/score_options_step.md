# Score Options Against Criteria

Rate each option on each criterion using consistent methodology.

## Scoring Methodology

1. **Define scale**: Choose scoring system (e.g., 1-5, 0-10)
2. **Set benchmarks**: Define what each score means
3. **Score systematically**: Evaluate each option-criterion pair
4. **Document rationale**: Explain each score
5. **Review consistency**: Check for fairness

## Scoring Considerations

- Use evidence to support scores
- Be consistent across options
- Consider both absolute and relative performance
- Account for uncertainty
- Document assumptions

## Scoring Process

- Review criteria and weights
- Gather evidence for each option
- Score each option-criterion combination
- Calculate weighted totals
- Review and validate scores

## Score Validation

- Check for consistency
- Verify evidence supports scores
- Review with stakeholders
- Identify and address biases
- Confirm scores reflect reality

## Score Documentation

- Record all individual scores
- Calculate weighted totals
- Document scoring rationale
- Note any adjustments
- Create summary comparisons
